<h1>Rational</h1>

<img src="images/rational.jpg" />

<p class =  "survey-paragraph">  You are both logical and creative. You are full of ideas. </br>
  You are so rational that you analyze everything. This drives people a little crazy! </br>

  Intelligence is important to you. You always like to be around smart people. </br>
  In fact, you're often a little short with people who don't impress you mentally. </br>

  You seem distant to some - but it's usually because you're deep in thought. </br>
  Those who understand you best are fellow Rationals. </br>

  In love, you tend to approach things with logic. You seek a compatible mate - who is also very intelligent. </br>

  At work, you tend to gravitate toward idea building careers - like programming, medicine, or academia. </br>

  With others, you are very honest and direct. People often can't take your criticism well. </br>

  As far as your looks go, you're coasting on what you were born with. You think fashion is silly. </br>

  On weekends, you spend most of your time thinking, experimenting with new ideas, or learning new things.</p>
